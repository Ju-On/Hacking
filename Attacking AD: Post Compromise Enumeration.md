Setup win2022 server: 192.168.64.138  
Setup Peterparker: \192.168.64.140  
Setup Frankcastle: 192.168.64.139

Now that we have compromised an account or have gotten user credentials, further **enumeration** will be conducted with these elevated access.

## ðŸš© Domain enumeration with ldapdomaindump  

If an IPv6 attack was conducted with mitm6 with the combination of ntlmrelayx, there is a possibility a dump was succesfully taken from the lootme -l switch.  

However if not, and the network does not have IPv6 DHCP enabled but we have user credentials from the **initial attack vectors** we can still query the LDAP to fetch us a LDAP domain dump.

    ldapdomaindump ldaps://192.168.64.138 -u 'MARVEL\fcastle' -p Password1

## ðŸš© Domain enumeration with Bloodhound
BloodHound is an AD attack path mapping tool that helps attackers and defenders discovery privilige escalation paths, lateral movement opportunities and AD misconfigurations.  

1. Download and install Bloodhound if it is not already installed.  
2. When first configuring Bloodhound use the below command line. This is also used to start the bloodhound console.  

        sudo neo4j console

4. Click on the link presented in the results to open the console and set a username / password.
5. Once set, open Bloodhound via the command line with 'Bloodhound'
6. Now we need to set an 'ingestor' back in terminal to capture the data.

        root@kali:/home/kali/bloodhound# bloodhound-python -d MARVEL.local -u fcastle -p Password1 -ns 192.168.64.138 -c all

Here i have created a directory specifically for this named bloodhound.

Once the .json files has been captured, we now import it into the Bloodhound console as seen below.

When all data has been loaded, we can now visualise the infomation by using the hamburger drop down.
