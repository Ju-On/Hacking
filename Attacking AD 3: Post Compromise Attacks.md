## ðŸš© 'Pass Attacks' - Pass the Password / Pass the Hash.  

### Pass the Password  
With a SAM dump and cracked hash, we have the ability to push the credentials around with every device that has the ability to recieve and accept the login attempt.

    crackmapexec smb 192.168.64.0/24 -u fcastle -d MARVEL.local -p Password1

We can see that the username and password has been passed around the network and was successful only on Spiderman and Thepunisher devices. Although there was a succesful authentication on Hyrda-DC, fcastle is not a local admin in that device therefore no login. 


### Pass the Hash  
With a SAM dump containing local Admin credentials, we can also pass an admin account credentials with the hash around the network and observe what devices will accept these credentials.
